Transforming Waste Management with Transfer Learning

🎯 Objective:
Use Transfer Learning to classify waste types to enable smart, efficient segregation systems.

🔍 Process:
1. Dataset: TrashNet (Images of various waste types)
2. Preprocessing & Augmentation
3. Model: MobileNetV2 pretrained on ImageNet
4. Added dense layers and softmax output
5. Evaluated with accuracy and loss plots

📈 Result:
Achieved 90%+ accuracy
Real-time classification possible in future

🔮 Future Scope:
- Deploy on smart bins
- Expand to hazardous/chemical waste
